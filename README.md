## R Markdown

In R, you can perform a variety of basic operations, including arithmetic, logical, and comparison operations. Hereâ€™s a summary of these operations with examples:



 ## Addition and Subtraction
 
```{r}

sum <- 3 + 2  # Addition
difference <- 5 - 3   # Subtraction
sum
difference
8 + 4 - 3
```

## Multiplication and Exponents

```{r}
product <- 4 * 2      # Multiplication
product
10 * 2

10*3^2
```
## Division

```{r}
quotient <- 8 / 4     # Division
quotient
10/20
10/5
```


## Parenthesis

```{r}
power <- 2^3  # Exponentiation
power
2 * (30 + 23)


```
